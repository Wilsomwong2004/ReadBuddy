## 1. Overview
ReadBuddy is a Chrome extension that enhances the reading experience by summarizing, translating, and analyzing web articles or PDFs directly in the browser.  
Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle your information.

---

## 2. Information Collection
ReadBuddy **does not collect, store, or sell** any personally identifiable information.  
The extension only temporarily accesses website or PDF text **on your device** to perform summarization, translation, and note-taking features.

- ✅ Website content: Accessed locally for summarization, translation, and mindmap generation.
- ❌ No browsing history, user identity, or login data is collected.
- ❌ No data is transmitted to external servers other than Firebase services used for authentication and optional cloud note storage.

---

## 3. Use of Firebase
ReadBuddy uses **Firebase Authentication and Firestore** (optional) to allow users to sign in and sync notes between devices.  
All data stored in Firebase is **under the user’s control** and protected by Google’s privacy and security standards.

---

## 4. Data Processing
ReadBuddy supports **hybrid AI processing**:
- **Local processing:** Summarization and translation may run directly in the browser using built-in AI models.
- **Online processing (Firebase AI):** When local processing is unavailable, content may be securely processed using Firebase AI APIs.  
No data is used for model training or shared with third parties.

---

## 5. Permissions
ReadBuddy requires certain permissions to function:
- `activeTab` and `tabs`: Access current page content when activated by the user.
- `sidePanel`: Display results (summary, translation, etc.) in a side panel.
- `contextMenus`: Enable right-click shortcuts.
- `storage`: Save user preferences and notes locally or in Firebase.

All permissions are used strictly for the extension’s stated purpose.

---

## 6. Data Security
We take reasonable steps to protect your information.  
Firebase data is encrypted in transit and at rest. No unencrypted data is transmitted.

---

## 7. Your Rights
You can delete your Firebase account or local data anytime through the extension interface.  
Once deleted, data cannot be recovered.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as needed.  
The latest version will always be available in the project repository.
